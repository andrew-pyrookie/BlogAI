AI tools can analyze large datasets, uncovering patterns and insights that would be impossible to detect manually. This technological advancement empowers journalists to conduct more thorough investigations, leading to greater accountability and transparency. However, the use of AI in this field also necessitates a careful consideration of ethical implications.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key benefits of AI in investigative journalism is its ability to sift through vast amounts of information quickly.
